# Dynamic Forms

## 📝 Your Notes

Elaborate on your learnings here in `src/exercise/07.md`

## Background

With React, the way you use state is via a special "hook" called `useState`.
Here's a simple example of what that looks like:

```jsx
function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0)
  const increment = () => setCount(count + 1)
  return <button onClick={increment}>{count}</button>
}
```

`React.useState` accepts a default initial value and returns an array. Typically
you'll destructure that array to get the state and a state updater function.

## Exercise

Production deploys:

- [Exercise](http://react-fundamentals.netlify.com/isolated/exercise/07.js)
- [Final](http://react-fundamentals.netlify.com/isolated/final/07.js)

In this exercise, we're going to say that this username input only accepts
lower-case characters. So if someone types an upper-case character, that's
invalid input and we'll show an error message.

If we want our form to be dynamic, we'll need a few things:

1. Component state to store the dynamic values (an error message in our case)
2. A change handler on the input so we know what the value is as the user
   changes it and can update the error state.

Once we have that wired up then we can render the error message and disable the
submit button if there's an error.

💰 This one's a little more tricky, so I'll be around to help you with some code
samples.
